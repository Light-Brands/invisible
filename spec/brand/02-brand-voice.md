# Brand Voice — Invisible Communication Style

## Overview
Invisible's voice is calm, direct, and no-nonsense. No marketing fluff. No hype. No exclamation points. Trust is built through transparency and technical honesty, not slogans.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Direct
Say exactly what you mean. No filler, no hedging, no corporate speak.

- **Yes**: "Messages are encrypted end-to-end. We can't read them."
- **No**: "We leverage industry-leading encryption technologies to ensure your communications remain secure and private!"

### 2. Calm
Even when discussing serious topics (surveillance, data breaches, government overreach), maintain composure. Panic is the enemy of security.

- **Yes**: "Your messages are gone. There's nothing to find."
- **No**: "PROTECT yourself from HACKERS and SPIES! Don't let them steal your data!!!"

### 3. Honest
Never overstate. Never make promises you can't cryptographically prove. If there's a limitation, say so.

- **Yes**: "Mesh messaging has limited range (~100m). It works best in dense environments."
- **No**: "Our revolutionary mesh technology connects you anywhere, anytime!"

### 4. Minimal
Fewer words is always better. If the app works correctly, the user shouldn't need to read much.

- **Yes**: "Connected."
- **No**: "You're now securely connected to our global privacy network! Your identity is protected."

## Tone by Context

### In-App UI Text
- Ultra-short. One word when possible.
- "Send" / "Connected" / "Verified" / "Burned"
- Error messages: clear and actionable. "VPN unreachable. Retrying..." not "Oops! Something went wrong."

### Security Explanations
- Technical but accessible. Assume the reader is intelligent.
- "Each message uses a unique encryption key, derived from a ratcheting algorithm. After decryption, the key is destroyed."
- Not dumbed down, not jargon-heavy. Clean technical prose.

### Marketing / Website
- Lead with the problem, not the solution.
- "Your messenger reads your messages. Your carrier logs your metadata. Your government can compel both."
- Then the solution, plainly stated.
- "Invisible doesn't. We can't. It's not a policy — it's math."

### Error States
- Never blame the user.
- Never use "oops" or "uh oh" or apologetic language.
- State what happened and what to do next.
- "Authentication failed. Check your 2FA code and try again."

## Words We Use
- Encrypted, private, secure, verified, destroyed, wiped, zero-knowledge
- "Your messages" (not "your data")
- "Your device" (not "your account")
- "Mathematically" / "cryptographically" (when describing guarantees)

## Words We Don't Use
- "Privacy-first" as a marketing buzzword (show, don't tell)
- "Military-grade" (meaningless)
- "Unhackable" (nothing is)
- "100% secure" (honest about threat models)
- "Revolutionary" / "Groundbreaking" / "Game-changing"
- Exclamation points in product copy
- Emoji in official communications

## Taglines
- Primary: **"Messages that leave no trace. Privacy that answers to no one."**
- Secondary: "If we can't read it, neither can they."
- Technical: "Zero-knowledge. Zero-trust. Zero-compromise."
- Short: "Leave no trace."
